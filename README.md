# Bank
Created a simple Bank Application with the use of a terminal to understand and brush up on the basic skills in Java.

We are initializing the values first
The Basic information is displayed and user input is taken,
1. Here firstly we are displaying the Menu using the print statement.
2. We are taking the input from the user by using the Scanner class.

Now that the input is taken what does the program perform,
3. So we have written different cases when a user inputs a value what would the program perform and provide us as an output.
